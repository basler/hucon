# Assembling

Usually your HuCon comes to you as a kit. The kit contains the following components:

1. Omega2+ from [Onion](https://onion.io/)
2. HuCon boards
3. Pin header

!!! attention
     It may be that the pin header is too long. In this case it must be shortened to the correct length of 16 pins.

It is recommended to solder the pin headers to the boards before removing them of the panel.

The boards can be cut with a small side cutter at the marked places after this.

The extent of separation can be removed carefully with a small file. This will let your robot stand more secure later on. :smile:

Afterwards the robot can be assembled as shown in the following picture.

First the boards (except the head) are assembled. On the boards there are small numbers documenting the assembly. If you look at the robot from below and all the numbers fit together, then you have put the boards together correctly.

After the correct board assembly the Omega2+ is inserted into the pin headers. The SD card slot has to face upwards. The HuCon is able to stand on its own if assembled correctly and will not tip over backwards.

Now all you have to do is put your head on your HuCon, and it's done.
